    <p>This a tradional food formed just Nshima. The concept is the same but only differs 
        with the time been used</p>

        <h2>Ingrediates <em><strong>Chikanda</strong></em></h2>
            <ol>Pounded Chikanda powder</ol>
        <ol>Water</ol>
        <ol>Soda powder</ol>
        <ol>Imbalala <em>Groundnuts</em></ol>

    <p><h2>Things to Have before starting to Prepare Chikanda</h2></p>
        
            <ol>1. Impoto: <em>Cooking Pot</em></ol>
            <ol>2. Umwinko: <em>Cooking stick</em></ol>
            <ol>3. Amenshi: <em>Water</em></ol>
            <ol>4. Umulilo: <em>Stove, Fire Braziare, Gas Sotove</em></ol>
                <em>The fire Should be well prepared when it is finished along 
                    the way the Chikanda will not be ready</em>
        

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>The most important thing to consider when making <strong><em>Chikanda</em></strong>
    is the amount of Water and the level of Fire.
    This is important beacuse less fire makes the <em>Chikanda</em> not to be fully
    prepared.</p>
    <p>The other important thing is the amount of Water been used to make the <em><strong>Chikanda</strong></em>
    this is countend depending on the amount of the Chkinda powderyou have</p>

    <h2>Steps to take </h2>
    <ol><h3>Step 1</h3></ol>
        <p>Put water in Impoto (<em> The Cooking Pot</em>)</p>
        <p>Wait for about 15 minutes for the Water to boil.</p>
    <ol><h3>Step 2</h3></ol>
        <p>Add Chikanda powder</p>
        <p>Contiue Stiring using a Cooking stick (<em>Umwinko</em></p>
        <p>Wait until the Solution is Solid: (Not solid in the form of a rock</p>
    <ol><h3>Step 3</h3></ol>
        <p>Wait for about 30 Minutes</p>
        <p>Continue Stiring in the Solution</p>
        <p>Cover the Cooking pot: <em>Impoto</em> for more than 30 minutes</p>
    <p>This step is important because it allows the Solution to be mixed thougly and
        effectively so that all the Chikanda poweder is mixed thougly</p>
    <ol><h3>Step 4</h3></ol>

    <p>This is a final and last Step</p>
        <p>After <em>15 - 30 minutes</em> of allowing to boil as a Solution now start
        adding more Chikanda poweder wilest continuening to stir in the cooking pot to make the 
    solution more solid</p>
    <p> Adding more Chikanda poweder to make the solute more hard to make into a Hard solution</p>
    <p>After <em>10 - 20 Minutes</em> of adding Chikanda poweder Now Should be in a Solution Suitable to 
    eat</p>

    <ol><h3>Are You Done?</h3></ol>
    <div> </div>
    <em><p>Wait a minute this looks like just copying the Nshima recipe and past it here only changin
        the names. could it be.</p>
        <p>No these are two different recipies that are prepared in the same 
            procedure.</p>
        <p>This is funny come to Zambia and you will think tat you are eating the same things over
                and over. The taste is way to good that you will notice that you are done eating.
    </p></em>
    <h2>So, getting back to the Question is the Chikanda ready?</h2> <p>It might looks so. The <em>Chikanda</em> in the pot looks delicious to be put
            already the in the mounth.
            But we still need one last step. This is the final and Last step</p>
    <ol><h3>Final Step</h3></ol>
    <p>Before I explain the final and last step I would like to empahsise the importance
        of this stage or step. If it happens that you get ot eat the Chikanda fast the end
        results are not friendly you will end up getting some bad stomatch pains.
        The test will not be very presant, we caall such kind as Chikanda Mbwelenge <em><strong>This is just 
            a friendly advice</strong></em></p>
    <p><h4>Lets Get to the last step Now</h4></p>
    <ol>Wait for another <em>10 - 15 minutes</em> this is before you put the Nshima 
    on the plates to be read to put on the table</ol>
