    <p><h2>Things to Have before starting to cook Nshima</h2></p>
        
            <ol>1. Impoto: <em>Cooking Pot</em></ol>
            <ol>2. Umwinko: <em>Cooking stick</em></ol>
            <ol>3. Amenshi: <em>Water</em></ol>
            <ol>4. Umulilo: <em>Stove, Fire Braziare, Gas Sotove</em></ol>
            <ol>5. Ubunga: <em>Melie Meal</em></ol>
        

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>The most important thing to consider when making <strong><em>Ubwali</em></strong>
    is the amount of Water and the level of Fire.
    This is important beacuse less fire makes the <em>Nshima</em> not to be fully
    prepared.</p>
    <p>The other important thing is the amount of Water been used to make the <em><strong>Nshima</strong></em>
    this is countend depending on te number of people and the level of Melie meal you have</p>

    <h2>Steps to take </h2>
    <ol><h3>Step 1</h3></ol>
        <p>Put water in Impoto (<em> The Cooking Pot</em>)</p>
        <p>Wait for about 15 minutes for the Water to boil.</p>
    <ol><h3>Step 2</h3></ol>
        <p>Add Millie</p>
        <p>Contiue Stiring using a Cooking stick (<em>Umwinko</em></p>
        <p>Wait until the Solution is Solid: (Not solid in the form of a rock</p>
    <ol><h3>Step 3</h3></ol>
        <p>Wait for about 15 Minutes</p>
        <p>Continue Stiring in the Solution</p>
        <p>Cover the Cooking pot: <em>Impoto</em> for more than 30 minutes</p>
    <p>This step is important because it allows the Solution to be mixed thougly and
        effectively so that all the Millie  meal is ok</p>
    <ol><h3>Step 4</h3></ol>
    <p>This is a final and last Step</p>
        <p>After <em>15 - 30 minutes</em> of allowing to boil as a Solution now start
        adding more Melie Meal wilest continuening to stir in the cooking pot to make the 
    solution more solid</p>
    <p> Adding more Melie Meal to make the solute more hard to make into nshima</p>
    <p>After <em>10 - 20 Minutes</em> of adding Melie Meal the Nshima Now Should be in a Solution Suitable to 
    eat</p>

    <ol><h3>Are You Done?</h3></ol>
    <div> </div>
         <p>It might looks so. The <em>Nshima</em> in the pot looks delicious to be put
            already the in the mounth.
            But we still need one last step. This is the final and Last step</p>
    <ol><h3>Final Step</h3></ol>
    <p>Before I explain the final and last step I would like to empahsise the importance
        of this stage or step. If it happens that you get ot eat the Nshima fast the end
        results are not friendly you will end up getting some bad stomatch pains. <em><strong>This is just 
            a friendly advice</strong></em></p>
    <p><h4>Lets Get to the last step Now</h4></p>
    <ol>Wait for another <em>10 - 15 minutes</em> this is before you put the Nshima 
    on the plates to be read to put on the table</ol>
